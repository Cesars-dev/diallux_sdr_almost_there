"""LangGraph builder — V3 production graph.

V1 translated the Retell runtime 1:1. V2 kept the same 9 state nodes and
loop semantics, plus:

  1. Prompts are read from `diallux/prompts/*.md` (editable source of truth,
     same content as the deployed llm.json — verified identical at build time).
  2. A `deterministic` node runs after EVERY state round — your "fix queued in
     the deterministic layer" open items, finally real:
       - leak math: when the three inputs exist and weekly_leak is empty,
         compute it server-side (the Closer can no longer stochastically skip
         the monetization pitch — open item #1 in your AGENTS.md)
       - today prefetch: entering ConfirmSlots with an empty today_date fetches
         /today directly (time never depends on the model remembering the tool)
  3. dvs flow through schema.DynamicVariables (typed; "" defaults; server-owned
     keys protected — see graph/tools.py).
  4. Transitions are hard-gated by the executor (edge `required` params must be
     truthy); the graph structure itself is unchanged because the executor is
     the single door for state swaps.
  5. Optional Postgres checkpointer (LANGGRAPH_CHECKPOINT=postgres) for
     multi-worker durability; MemorySaver fallback per call.

V3 adds (see ITERATIONS.md):
  6. RAG knowledge bases: pgvector top-3 retrieval per turn (the DEPLOYED
     Retell kb_config was {filter_score: 0.6, top_k: 3} — server-side RAG,
     now self-hosted). Inline full-KB fallback when Postgres is unavailable.
  7. VOICE OUTPUT RULES appended to the system prompt (Cartesia's voice-agent
     starter rules) so the model writes text the TTS reads well; the
     deterministic normalizer (media/normalize.py) backs it up per sentence.

One graph invocation == one user utterance (unchanged).

## VOICE OUTPUT RULES (your text is spoken by a real-time TTS engine)
- Plain conversational prose. No markdown, bullet points, emoji, or special characters — they get read aloud.
- Always finish sentences with . ? or !
- Phone numbers, verification codes, and any run of 5+ digits: one character at a time, comma-separated, like 3, 1, 2, 4, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Dollar amounts, dates, times: write them normally ($6,500, September 4th, 2:30 PM) — the engine reads them naturally.
- Tool arguments are never spoken; only your reply text is.
