"""Configuration for the Dialux SDR LangGraph runtime (production build).

V3 iteration (see ITERATIONS.md):
  - RAG knowledge bases on Postgres+pgvector (RAG_MODE=auto; inline fallback)
  - TTS normalization before every spoken sentence (the Retell-native feature)
  - TTS provider switch: Cartesia (default) or ElevenLabs (your Chloe settings)
  - Cartesia generation_config (speed/volume/emotion) per request
  - VOICE OUTPUT RULES appended to the system prompt (Cartesia's voice-agent
    starter rules — ON in production; the deterministic normalizer backs it)
  - openai_temperature defaults to 0.3 (your ask). NOTE: gpt-5.x reasoning
    models only accept the default temperature — the guard in graph/llm.py
    omits it for gpt-5* so the API doesn't 400; set OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1 to
    make 0.3 actually apply.

V5 iteration (see ITERATIONS.md §16):
  - Per-state delivery profiles (media/delivery.py): the state machine
    controls emotion/speed — Cartesia generation_config and ElevenLabs
    voice_settings per turn, driven by the graph state, not the LLM.
    TTS_DELIVERY_PROFILES=false restores exact V4 behavior (.env globals).
