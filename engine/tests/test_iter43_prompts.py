"""iter43 — prompt-shape pins (Offer consent ask PROMPT-FIRST + contact_details
softening) + iter40 no-drift byte lockstep.

Pins:
  a. Offer.md carries the consent ask ("walk you through") and NO date binary
     ("later today or tomorrow" is dead — scheduling belongs to ConfirmSlots)
  b. contact_details.md carries the demo lead-in + the attendee-name fallback
     rule (never re-ask a declined name)
  c. llm.json state_prompt for Offer + contact_details is BYTE-IDENTICAL to
